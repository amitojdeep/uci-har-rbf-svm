# Multi-class SVM with RBF kernel for activity classification from UCI HAR dataset
This repo contains my submission for the final project in SYDE 675 Pattern Recognition at University of Waterloo. SVM with RBF is used to classify human activities from UCI HAR dataset. It is compared with other machine learning methods and the effect of PCA on the results is also studied.
The use of grid search and k times k fold cross validation for parameter search and training is also demonstrated.

An accuracy of 96.53% is acheived with SVM-RBF. Please read the uci-har.pdf for detailed results and comparison with literature.
